== Introduction

=== Overview

Jakarta™ Platform, Enterprise Edition (Jakarta EE) server containers such as
the enterprise bean or web component container do not recommend using
common Java SE concurrency APIs such as java.lang.Thread or
java.util.Timer directly.

The server containers provide runtime support for Jakarta EE application
components (such as Jakarta Servlets and Jakarta Enterprise Beans). They
provide a layer between application component code and platform services
and resources. All application component code is run on a thread managed
by a container and each container typically expects all access to
container-supplied objects to occur on the same thread.

It is because of this behavior that application components are typically
unable to reliably use other Jakarta EE platform services from a thread
that is not managed by the container.

Jakarta EE Product Providers (see chapter 2.11 of the Jakarta EE 9
Specification) also discourage the use of resources in a non-managed
way, because it can potentially undermine the enterprise features that
the platform is designed to provide such as availability, security, and
reliability and scalability.

This specification provides a simple, standardized API for using
concurrency from Jakarta EE application components without compromising the
integrity of the container while still preserving the fundamental
benefits of the Jakarta EE platform.

=== Goals of this specification

This specification was developed with the following goals in mind:

* Utilize existing applicable Jakarta EE platform services. Provide a
simple yet flexible API for application component providers to design
applications using concurrency design principles.
* Allow Java SE developers a simple migration path to the Jakarta EE
platform by providing consistency between the Java SE and Jakarta EE
platforms.
* Allow application component providers to easily add concurrency to
existing Jakarta EE applications.
* Support simple (common) and advanced concurrency patterns without
sacrificing usability.

== Overview

The focus of this specification is on providing asynchronous
capabilities to Jakarta EE application components. This is largely achieved
through extending the Concurrency Utilities API developed under JSR-166
and found in Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE) in the
java.util.concurrent package.

The Java SE concurrency utilities provide an API that can be extended to
support the majority of the goals defined in section 1.2. Application
developers familiar with this API in the Java SE platform can leverage
existing code libraries and usage patterns with little modification.

This specification has several aspects:

* Definition and usage of centralized, manageable
java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService objects in a Jakarta EE application
server.
* Usage of Java SE Concurrency Utilities in a Jakarta EE application.
* Propagation of the Jakarta EE container's runtime contextual information
to other threads.
* Managing and monitoring the lifecycle of asynchronous operations in a
Jakarta EE Application Component.
* Preserving application integrity.

=== Container-Managed vs. Unmanaged Threads

Jakarta EE application servers require resource management in order to
centralize administration and protect application components from
consuming unneeded resources. This can be achieved through the pooling
of resources and managing a resource’s lifecycle. Using Java SE
concurrency utilities such as the `java.util.concurrent` API,
`java.lang.Thread` and `java.util.Timer` in a server application component
such as a servlet or Jakarta Enterprise Bean are problematic since the container and server
have no knowledge of these resources.

By extending the `java.util.concurrent` API, application servers and Jakarta
EE containers can become aware of the resources that are used and
provide the proper execution context for the asynchronous operations.

This is largely achieved by providing managed versions of the
predominant `java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService` interfaces.

=== Application Integrity

Managed environments allow applications to coexist without causing harm
to the overall system and isolate application components from one
another. Administrators can adjust deployment and runtime settings to
provide different qualities of service, provisioning of resources,
scheduling of tasks, etc. Jakarta EE containers also provide runtime
context services to the application component. When using concurrency
utilities such as those in java.util.concurrent, these context services
need to be available.

=== Container Thread Context

Jakarta EE depends on various context information to be available on the
thread when interacting with other Jakarta EE services such as JDBC data
sources, Jakarta Messaging providers and Jakarta Enterrise Beans. When using Jakarta EE services from a
non-container thread, the following behaviors are required:

* Saving the application component thread’s container context.
* Identifying which container contexts to save and propagate.
* Applying a container context to the current thread.
* Restoring a thread's original context.

The types of contexts to be propagated from a contextualizing
application component include JNDI naming context, classloader, and
security information. Containers must support propagation of these
context types. In addition, containers can choose to support propagation
of other types of context.

The relationships between the various Jakarta EE architectural elements,
containers and concurrency constructs are shown in Figure 2‑1.

Containers (represented here in a single rectangle) provide environments
for application components to safely interact with Jakarta EE Standard
Services (represented in the rectangles directly below the Enterprise Bean/Web
Container rectangle). Four new concurrency services (represented by four
dark-gray rectangles) allow application components and Jakarta EE Standard
Services to run asynchronous tasks without violating container
contracts.

The arrows in the diagram illustrate various flows from one part of the
Jakarta EE platform to another.

==== Contextual Invocation Points

Container context and management constructs are propagated to component
business logic at runtime using various invocation points on well-known
interfaces. These invocation points or callback methods, here-by known
as "tasks" will be referred to throughout the specification:

* `java.util.concurrent.Callable`
** `call()`
* `java.lang.Runnable`
** `run()`

===== Optional Contextual Invocation Points

The following callback methods run with unspecified context by default,
but may be configured as contextual invocation points if desired:

* `jakarta.enterprise.concurrent.ManagedTaskListener`
** `taskAborted()`
** `taskSubmitted()`
** `taskStarting()`

* `jakarta.enterprise.concurrent.Trigger`
** `getNextRunTime()`
** `skipRun()`

It is not required that container context be propagated to the threads
that invoke these methods. This is to avoid the overhead of setting up
the container context when it may not be needed in these callback
methods. These methods can be made contextual through the ContextService
(see following sections), which can make any Java object contextual.

==== Contextual Objects and Tasks

Tasks are concrete implementations of the Java SE
`java.util.concurrent.Callable` and `java.lang.Runnable` interfaces (see the
Javadoc for `java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService`). Tasks are units of
work that represent a computation or some business logic.

A contextual object is any Java object instance that has a particular
application component's thread context associated with it (for example,
user identity).

[NOTE]
====
Contextual Objects and Tasks referred here is not the same as
the Context object as defined in the Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection specification. See section_ _2.3.2.1_ _on
using CDI beans as tasks._
====

When a task instance is submitted to a managed instance of an
ExecutorService, the task becomes a contextual task. When the contextual
task runs, the task behaves as if it were still running in the container
it was submitted with.

image::3.jpg[Contextual Task]
*Figure 2‑2 Contextual Task*

===== Tasks and Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI) 

CDI beans can be used as tasks. Such tasks could make use of injection
if they are themselves components or are created dynamically using
various CDI APIs. However, application developers should be aware of the
following when using CDI beans as tasks:

* Tasks that are submitted to a managed instance of ExecutorService may
still be running after the lifecycle of the submitting component.
Therefore, CDI beans with a scope of `@RequestScoped`, `@SessionScoped`, or
`@ConversationScoped` are not recommended to use as tasks as it cannot be
guaranteed that the tasks will complete before the CDI context is
destroyed.
* CDI beans with a scope of `@ApplicationScoped` or `@Dependent` can be used
as tasks. However, it is still possible that the task could be running
beyond the lifecycle of the submitting component, such as when the
component is destroyed.
* The transitive closure of CDI beans that are injected into tasks
should follow the above guidelines regarding their scopes.

=== Usage with Jakarta Connectors

The Jakarta Connectors allows creating resource
adapters that can plug into any compatible Jakarta EE application server.
The Connectors specification provides a WorkManager interface that
allows asynchronous processing for the resource adapter. It does not
provide a mechanism for Jakarta EE applications to interact with an
adapter’s WorkManager.

This specification addresses the need for Jakarta EE applications to run
application business logic asynchronously using a
`jakarta.enterprise.concurrent.ManagedExecutorService` or
`java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService` with a
`jakarta.enterprise.concurrent.ManagedThreadFactory`. It is the intent that
Connectors `jakarta.resource.work.WorkManager` implementations may choose to
utilize or wrap the `java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService` or other
functionalities within this specification when appropriate.

Resource Adapters can access each of the Managed Objects described in
the following sections by looking them up in the JNDI global namespace,
through the JNDI context of the accessing application (see section
10.3.2 of the Connectors specification).

=== Security

This specification largely defers most security decisions to the
container and Jakarta EE Product Provider as defined in the Jakarta EE
Specification.

If the container supports a security context, the Jakarta EE Product
Provider must propagate that security context to the thread of
execution.

Application Component Providers should use the interfaces provided in
this specification when interacting with threads. If the Jakarta EE Product
Provider has implemented a security manager, some operations may not be
allowed.

== Managed Objects

This section introduces four programming interfaces for Jakarta EE Product
Providers to implement (see EE.2.11 for a detailed definition of each of
the roles described here). Instances of these interfaces must be made
available to application components through containers as managed
objects:

* Section 3.1, "ManagedExecutorService" –The interface for submitting
asynchronous tasks from a container.
* Section 3.2, "ManagedScheduledExecutorService" – The interface for
scheduling tasks to run after a given delay or execute periodically.
* Section 3.3, "ContextService" – The interface for creating contextual
objects.
* Section 3.4, "ManagedThreadFactory" – The interface for creating
managed threads.

=== ManagedExecutorService

The `jakarta.enterprise.concurrent.ManagedExecutorService` is an interface
that extends the `java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService` interface. Jakarta EE
Product Providers provide implementations of this interface to allow
application components to run tasks asynchronously.

==== Application Component Provider’s Responsibilities

Application Component Providers (application developers) (EE2.11.2) use
a ManagedExecutorService instance and associated interfaces to develop
application components that utilize the concurrency functions that these
interfaces provide. Instances for these objects are retrieved using the
Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) Naming Context (EE.5) or
through injection of resource environment references (EE.5.8.1.1).

The Application Component Provider may use resource environment
references to obtain references to a ManagedExecutorService instance as
follows:

* Assign an entry in the application component’s environment to the
reference using the reference type of:
`jakarta.enterprise.concurrent.ManagedExecutorService`. (See EE.5.8.1.3 for
information on how resource environment references are declared in the
deployment descriptor.)
* Look up the managed object in the application component’s environment
using JNDI (EE.5.2), or through resource injection by the use of the
Resource annotation (EE.5.8.1.1).

This specification recommends, but does not require, that all resource
environment references be organized in the appropriate subcontext of the
component’s environment for the resource type. For example, all
`ManagedExecutorService` references should be bound in the
`java:comp/env/concurrent` subcontext.

Components create task classes by implementing the `java.lang.Runnable` or
`java.util.concurrent.Callable` interfaces. These task classes are
typically stored with the Jakarta EE application component.

Task classes can optionally implement the
`jakarta.enterprise.concurrent.ManagedTask` interface to provide execution
properties and to register a
`jakarta.enterprise.concurrent.ManagedTaskListener` instance to receive
lifecycle events notifications. Execution properties allow configuration
and control of various aspects of the task including whether to suspend
any current transaction on the thread and to provide identity
information.

Task instances are submitted to a `ManagedExecutorService` instance using
any of the defined `submit()`, `execute()`, `invokeAll()`, or `invokeAny()`
methods. Task instances will run as an extension of the Jakarta EE
container instance that submitted the task and may interact with Jakarta EE
resources as defined in other sections of this specification.

It is important for Application Component Providers to identify and
document the required behaviors and service-level agreements for each
required ManagedExecutorService. The following example illustrates how
the component can describe and utilize multiple executors.

===== Usage Example

In this example, an application component is performing two asynchronous
operations from a servlet. One operation (reporter) is starting a task
to generate a long running report. The other operations are
short-running tasks that parallelize access to different back-end
databases (builders).

Since each type of task has a completely different run profile, it makes
sense to use two different `ManagedExecutorService` resource environment
references. The attributes of each reference are documented using the
`<description>` tag within the deployment descriptor of the application
component and later mapped by the Deployer.

====== Reporter Task

The Reporter Task is a long-running task that communicates with a
database to generate a report. The task is run asynchronously using a
`ManagedExecutorService`. The client can then poll the server for the
results.

====== Resource Environment Reference - Reporter Task

The following resource environment reference is added to the web.xml
file for the web component. The description reflects the desired
configuration attributes (see 3.1.4.1 ). Alternatively, the Resource
annotation can be used in the Servlet code.

[NOTE]
====
Using the description for documenting the configuration
attributes of the managed object is optional. The format used here is
only an example. Future revisions of Jakarta EE specifications may
formalize usages such as this._
====

[source,xml]
----
<resource-env-ref>
  <description>
    This executor is used for the application’s reporter task.
    This executor has the following requirements:
    Context Info: Local Namespace
  </description> 
  <resource-env-ref-name>
    concurrent/LongRunningTasksExecutor
  </resource-env-ref-name>
  <resource-env-ref-type>
    jakarta.enterprise.concurrent.ManagedExecutorService
  </resource-env-ref-type>
</resource-env-ref>
----
====== Task Definition – Reporter Task

The task itself simply uses a resource-reference to a JDBC data source,
and uses a connect/use/close pattern when invoking the Datasource.
[source,java]
----
public class ReporterTask implements Runnable {
  String reportName;

  public ReporterTask(String reportName) {
    this.reportName = reportName;
  }

public void run() {
  // Run the named report
  if("TransactionReport".equals(reportName)) {
    runTransactionReport();
  }
  else if("SummaryReport".equals(reportName)) {
    runSummaryReport();
  }
}

Datasource ds = …;

void runTransactionReport() {
  try (Connection con = ds.getConnection(); ...) {
  
    // Read/Write the data using our connection.
    ...
    // Commit.
    con.commit();
  }
}
----

====== Task Submission – Reporter Task

The task is started by an HTTP client connecting to a servlet. The
client specifies the report name and other parameters to run. The handle
to the task (the Future) is cached so that the client can query the
results of the report. The Future will contain the results once the task
has completed.

[source,java]
----
public class AppServlet extends HTTPServlet implements Servlet {
  
  // Cache our executor instance
  @Resource(name=”concurrent/LongRunningTasksExecutor”)
  ManagedExecutorService mes;

  protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) throws ServletException, IOException {

    // Get the name of the report to run from the input params...
    // Assemble the header for the response.
    // Create a task instance
    ReporterTask reporterTask = new ReporterTask(reportName);

    // Submit the task to the ManagedExecutorService
    Future reportFuture = mes.submit(reporterTask);

    // Cache the future somewhere (like the client's session)
    // The client can then poll the servlet to determine
    // the status of the report.
    ...

    // Tell the user that the report has been submitted. +
    ... 
  } 
}
----

====== Builder Tasks

This servlet accesses two different data sources and aggregates the
results before returning the page contents to the user. Instead of
accessing the data synchronously, it is instead done in parallel using
two different tasks.

====== Resource Environment Reference – Builder Tasks

The following resource environment reference is added to the web.xml
file for the web component. The description reflects the desired
configuration attributes (see 3.1.4.1 ). Alternatively, the Resource
annotation can be used in the Servlet code:

[NOTE]
====
Using the description for documenting the configuration
attributes of the managed object is optional. The format used here is
only an example. Future revisions of Jakarta EE specifications may
formalize usages such as this._
====

[source,xml]
----
<resource-env-ref>
  <description>
    This executor is used for the application’s builder tasks.
    This executor has the following requirements:
    Context Info: Local Namespace, Security
  </description>
  <resource-env-ref-name>
    concurrent/BuilderExecutor
  </resource-env-ref-name>
  <resource-env-ref-type>
    jakarta.enterprise.concurrent.ManagedExecutorService
  </resource-env-ref-type>
</resource-env-ref>
----

====== Task Definition – Builder Tasks

The task itself simply uses some mechanism such as JDBC queries to
retrieve the data from the persistent store. The task implements the
`jakarta.enterprise.concurrent.ManagedTask` interface and supplies an
identifiable name through the IDENTITY_NAME property to allow system
administrators to diagnose problems.

[source,java]
----
public class AccountTask implements Callable<AccountInfo>, ManagedTask
{
  // The ID of the request to report on demand.
  String reqID;

  String accountID;
  Map<String, String> execProps;

  public AccountTask(String reqID, String accountID) {
    this.reqID=reqID;
    this.accountID=accountID;
    execProps = new HashMap<>();
    execProps.put(ManagedTask.IDENTITY_NAME, getIdentityName());
  }

  public AccountInfo call() {

    // Retrieve account info for the account from some persistent store
    AccountInfo info = ...;
    return info;
  }

  public String getIdentityName() {
    return "AccountTask: ReqID=" + reqID + ", Acct=" + accountID;
  }

  public Map<String, String> getExecutionProperties() {
    return execProps;
  }

  public ManagedTaskListener getManagedTaskListener() {
    return null;
  }
}

public class InsuranceTask implements Callable<InsuranceInfo>, ManagedTask {
  
  // The ID of the request to report on demand.
  String reqID

  String accountID;
  Map<String, String> execProps;

  public InsuranceTask (String reqID, String accountID) {
    this.reqID=reqID;
    this.accountID=accountID;
    execProps = new HashMap<>();

    execProps.put(ManagedTask.IDENTITY_NAME, getIdentityName());
  }

  public InsuranceInfo call() {
    // Retrieve the insurance info for the account from some persistent store
    InsuranceInfo info = ...;
    return info;
  }

  public String getIdentityName() {
    return "InsuranceTask: ReqID=" + reqID + ", Acct=" + accountID;
  }

  public Map<String, String> getExecutionProperties() 
    return execProps;
  }

  public ManagedTaskListener getManagedTaskListener() {
    return null;
  }
}
----

====== Task Invocation – Builder Tasks

Tasks are created on demand by a request to the servlet from an HTTP
client.

[source,java]
----
public class AppServlet extends HttpServlet implements Servlet {

  // Retrieve our executor instance.
  @Resource(name=”concurrent/BuilderExecutor”)
  ManagedExecutorService mes;

  protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) throws ServletException, IOException {
    // Get our arguments from the request (accountNumber and
    // requestID, in this case.
    // Assemble the header for the response.
    // Create and submit the task instances

    Future<AccountInfo> acctFuture = mes.submit(new AccountTask(reqID, accountID));

    Future<InsuranceInfo> insFuture = mes.submit (new InsuranceTask(reqID, accountID));

    // Wait for the results.
    AccountInfo accountInfo = acctFuture.get();
    InsuranceInfo insInfo = insFuture.get();

    // Process the results
  }
}
----
==== Application Assembler’s Responsibilities 

The Application Assembler (EE.2.11.3) is responsible for assembling the
application components into a complete Jakarta EE application and providing
assembly instructions that describe the dependencies to the managed
objects.

==== Deployer’s Responsibilities 

The Deployer (EE.2.11.4) is responsible for deploying the application
components into a specific operational environment. In the terms of this
specification, the Deployer installs the application components and maps
the dependencies defined by the Application Component Provider and
Application Assembler to managed objects with the properly defined
attributes. See EE.5.8.2 for details.

==== Jakarta EE Product Provider’s Responsibilities 

The Jakarta EE Product Provider’s responsibilities are as defined in
EE.5.8.3.

Jakarta EE Product Providers may include other contexts (e.g. Locale) that
may be propagated to a task or a thread that invokes the callback
methods in the `jakarta.enterprise.concurrent.ManagedTaskListener`
interface. `ManagedExecutorService` implementations may add any additional
contexts and provide the means for configuration of those contexts in
any way so long as these contexts do not violate the required aspects of
this specification.

The following section illustrates some possible configuration options
that a Jakarta EE Product Provider may want to provide.

===== ManagedExecutorService Configuration Attributes

Each ManagedExecutorService may support one or more runtime behaviors as
specified by configuration attributes. The Jakarta EE Product Provider will
determine both the appropriate attributes and the means of configuring
those attributes for their product.

===== Configuration Examples 

This section and subsections illustrate some examples of how a Jakarta EE
Product Provider could configure a ManagedExecutorService and the
possible options that such a service could provide.

Providers may choose a more simplistic approach, or may choose to add
more functionality, such as a higher quality-of-service, persistence,
task partitioning or shared thread pools.

Each of the examples has the following attributes:

* *Name*: An arbitrary name of the service for the deployer to use as a
reference.
* *JNDI name*: The arbitrary, but required, name to identify the service
instance. The deployer uses this value to map the service to the
component’s resource environment reference.
* *Context*: A reference to a `ContextService` instance (see section 3.3).
The context service can be used to define the context to propagate to
the threads when running tasks. Having more than one `ContextService`,
each with a different policy may be desirable for some implementations.
If both Context and ThreadFactory attributes are specified, the Context
attribute of the ThreadFactory configuration should be ignored.
* *ThreadFactory*: A reference to a `ManagedThreadFactory` instance (see
section 3.4). The `ManagedThreadFactory` instance can create threads with
different attributes (such as priority).
* *Thread Use:* If the application intends to run short vs. long-running
tasks they can specify to use pooled or daemon threads.
* *Hung Task Threshold*: The amount of time in milliseconds that a task
can execute before it is considered hung.
* *Pool Info*: If the executor is a thread pool, then the various thread
pool attributes can be defined (this is based on the attributes for the
Java `java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor` class):
**  *Core Size*: The number of threads to keep in the pool, even if they
are idle.
**  *Maximum Size*: The maximum number of threads to allow in the pool
(could be unbounded).
**  *Keep Alive*: The time to allow threads to remain idle when the
number of threads is greater than the core size.
**  *Work Queue Capacity*: The number of tasks that can be stored in the
input bounded buffer (could be unbounded).
* *Reject Policy*: The policy to use when a task is to be rejected by
the executor. In this example, two policies are available:
** *Abort*: Throw an exception when rejected.
** *Retry and Abort*: Automatically resubmit to another instance and
abort if it fails.

====== Typical Thread Pool 

The Typical Thread Pool illustrates a common configuration for an
application server with few applications. Each application expects to
run a small number of short-duration tasks in the local process.

====== OLTP Thread Pool 

The OLTP (On-Line Transaction Processing) Thread Pool executor uses a
thread pool with many more threads and a low hung-task threshold. It
also uses a thread factory that creates threads with a slightly higher
priority and a ContextService with a limited amount of context
information.

|===

##Table : OLTP Thread Pool Configuration Example

===== Default ManagedExecutorService

The Jakarta EE Product Provider must provide a preconfigured, default
ManagedExecutorService for use by application components under the JNDI
name `java:comp/DefaultManagedExecutorService`. The types of contexts to
be propagated by this default `ManagedExecutorService` from a
contextualizing application component must include naming context,
classloader, and security information.

==== System Administrator’s Responsibilities 

The System Administrator (EE.2.11.5) is responsible for monitoring and
overseeing the runtime environment. In the scope of this specification,
these duties may include:

* monitoring for hung tasks
* monitoring resource usage (for example, threads and memory)

==== Lifecycle

The lifecycle of `ManagedExecutorService` instances are centrally managed
by the application server and cannot be changed by an application.

A `ManagedExecutorService` instance is intended to be used by multiple
components and applications. When the executor runs a task, the context
of the thread is changed to match the component instance that submitted
the task. The context is then restored when the task is complete.

In Figure 3‑1, a single `ManagedExecutorService` instance is used to run
tasks (in blue) from multiple application components (each denoted in a
different color). Each task, when submitted to the
`ManagedExecutorService` automatically retains the context of the
submitting component and it becomes a Contextual Task. When the
`ManagedExecutorService` runs the task, the task would be run in the
context of the submitting component (as noted by different colored boxes
in the figure).

image:1.jpg[Managed Thread Pool Executor Component Relationship]
*Figure 3‑1 Managed Thread Pool Executor Component Relationship*

`ManagedExecutorService` instances may be terminated or suspended by the
application server when applications or components are stopped or the
application server itself is shutting down.

===== Jakarta EE Product Provider Requirements 

This subsection describes additional requirements for
ManagedExecutorService providers.

[arabic]
. All tasks, when executed from the `ManagedExecutorService`, will run
with the Jakarta EE component identity of the component that submitted the
task.
. The lifecycle of a `ManagedExecutorService` is managed by an application
server. All lifecycle operations on the `ManagedExecutorService` interface
will throw a `java.lang.IllegalStateException` exception. This includes
the following methods that are defined in the
`java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService` interface: `awaitTermination()`,
`isShutdown()`, `isTerminated()`, `shutdown()`, and `shutdownNow()`.
. No task submitted to an executor can run if task’s component is not
started.

When a `ManagedExecutorService` instance is being shutdown by the Jakarta EE
Product Provider:

[arabic]
. All attempts to submit new tasks are rejected.
. All submitted tasks are cancelled if not running.
. All running task threads are interrupted.
. All registered ManagedTaskListeners are invoked.

==== Quality of Service 

`ManagedExecutorService` implementations must support the at-most-once
quality of service. The at-most-once quality of service guarantees that
a task will run at most one time. This quality of service is the most
efficient method to run tasks. Tasks submitted to an executor with this
quality of service are transient in nature, are not persisted, and do
not survive process restarts.

Other qualities of service are allowed, but are not addressed in this
specification.

==== Transaction Management 

`ManagedExecutorService` implementations must support user-managed global
transaction demarcation using the `jakarta.transaction.UserTransaction`
interface, which is described in the Jakarta Transactions specification.
User-managed transactions allow components to manually control global
transaction demarcation boundaries. Task implementations may optionally
begin, commit, and roll-back a transaction. See EE.4 for details on
transaction management in Jakarta EE.

Task instances are run outside of the scope of the transaction of the
submitting thread. Any transaction active in the executing thread will
be suspended.

===== Jakarta EE Product Provider Requirements 

This subsection describes the transaction management requirements of a
`ManagedExecutorService` implementation.

[arabic]
. `The jakarta.transaction.UserTransaction` interface must be made available
in the local JNDI namespace as environment entry:
`java:comp/UserTransaction` (EE.5.10 and EE.4.2.1.1)
. All resource managers must enlist with a `UserTransaction` instance when
a transaction is active using the `begin()` method.
. The executor is responsible for coordinating commits and rollbacks
when the transaction ends using `commit()` and `rollback()` methods.
. A task must have the same ability to use transactions as the component
submitting the tasks. For example, tasks are allowed to call
transactional enterprise beans, and managed beans that use the
`@Transactional` interceptor as defined in the Jakarta Transactions
specification.

===== Application Component Provider’s Requirements 

This subsection describes the transaction management requirements of
each task provider’s implementation.

[arabic]
. A task instance that starts a transaction must complete the
transaction before starting a new transaction.
. The task provider uses the `jakarta.transaction.UserTransaction` interface
to demarcate transactions.
. Transactions are demarcated using the `begin()`, `commit()` and `rollback()`
methods of the `UserTransaction` interface.
. While an instance is in an active transaction, resource-specific
transaction demarcation APIs must not be used (e.g., if a
`java.sql.Connection` is enlisted in the transaction instance, the
`Connection.commit()` and `Connection.rollback()` methods must not be used).
. The task instance must complete the transaction before the task method
ends.

====== UserTransaction Usage Example 

The following example illustrates how a task can interact with two
XA-capable resources in a single transaction:

[source,java]
----
public class TranTask implements Runnable {

  UserTransaction ut = …;

  public void run() {

    // Start a transaction
    ut.begin();

    // Invoke an Jakarta Enterprise Bean
    ...

    // 
    Update a database using an XA capable JDBC DataSource
    ...

    // Commit the transaction
    ut.commit();
  }
}
----

=== ManagedScheduledExecutorService

The `jakarta.enterprise.concurrent.ManagedScheduledExecutorService` is an
interface that extends the `java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService`
and `jakarta.enterprise.concurrent.ManagedExecutorService` interfaces. Jakarta
EE Product Providers provide implementations of this interface to allow
applications to run tasks at specified and periodic times.

The `ManagedScheduledExecutorService` offers the same managed semantics as
the `ManagedExecutorService` and includes the delay and periodic task
running capabilities that the `ScheduledExecutorService` interface
provides with the addition of `Trigger` and `ManagedTaskListener`.

==== Application Component Provider’s Responsibilities 

Application Component Providers (application developers) (EE2.11.2) use
a `ManagedScheduledExecutorService` instance and associated interfaces to
develop application components that utilize the concurrency functions
that these interfaces provide. Instances for these objects are retrieved
using the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) Naming Context
(EE.5.2) or through injection of resource environment references
(EE.5.8.1.1).

The Application Component Provider may use resource environment
references to obtain references to a `ManagedScheduledExecutorService`
instance as follows:

* Assign an entry in the application component’s environment to the
reference using the reference type of:
`jakarta.enterprise.concurrent.ManagedScheduledExecutorService`. (See
EE.5.8.1.2 for information on how resource environment references are
declared in the deployment descriptor.)
* Look up the managed object in the application component’s environment
using JNDI (EE.5.2), or through resource injection by the use of the
`@Resource` annotation (EE.5.8.1.1).

This specification recommends, but does not require, that all resource
environment references be organized in the appropriate subcontext of the
component’s environment for the resource type. For example, all
`ManagedScheduledExecutorService` references should be declared in the
`java:comp/env/concurrent` subcontext.

Components create task classes by implementing the `java.lang.Runnable` or
`java.util.concurrent.Callable` interfaces. These task classes are
typically stored with the Jakarta EE application component.

Task instances are submitted to a `ManagedScheduledExecutorService`
instance using any of the defined `submit()`, `execute()`, `invokeAll()`,
`invokeAny()`, `schedule()`, `scheduleAtFixedRate()` or
`scheduleWithFixedDelay()` methods. Task instances will run as an
extension of the Jakarta EE container instance that submitted the task and
may interact with Jakarta EE resources as defined in other sections of this
specification.

Task classes can optionally implement the
`jakarta.enterprise.concurrent.ManagedTask` interface to provide execution
properties and to register a
`jakarta.enterprise.concurrent.ManagedTaskListener` instance to receive
lifecycle events notifications. Execution properties allow configuration
and control of various aspects of the task including whether to suspend
any current transaction on the thread and to provide identity
information.

It is important for Application Component Providers to identify and
document the required behaviors and service-level agreements for each
required `ManagedScheduledExecutorService`. The following example
illustrates how the component can describe and utilize a
`ManagedScheduledExecutorService`.

===== Usage Example 

In this example, an application component wants to use a timer to
periodically write in- memory events to a database log.

The attributes of the `ManagedScheduledExecutorService` reference is
documented using the `<description>` tag within the deployment descriptor
of the application component and later mapped by the Deployer.

====== Logger Timer Task 

The Logger Timer Task is a short-running, periodic task that has the
same lifecycle as the servlet. It periodically wakes up and dumps a
queue's contents to a database log. Its lifecycle is controlled using a
`jakarta.servlet.ServletContextListener`.

====== Resource Environment Reference 

The following resource environment reference is added to the web.xml
file for the web component. The description reflects the desired
configuration attributes (see 3.2.4.1 ). Alternatively, the Resource
annotation can be used in the Servlet code.

[NOTE]
====
Using the description for documenting the configuration
attributes of the managed object is optional. The format used here is
only an example. Future revisions of Jakarta EE specifications may
formalize usages such as this._
====

[source,xml]
----
<resource-env-ref>

  <resource-env-ref-type>
    jakarta.enterprise.concurrent.ManagedScheduledExecutorService
  </resource-env-ref-type>
</resource-env-ref>
----
====== Task Definition 

The task itself simply uses a resource-reference to a JDBC data source,
and uses a connect/use/close pattern when invoking the Datasource.

[source,java]
----
public class LoggerTimer implements Runnable {
  DataSource ds = ...;

  public void run() {
    logEvents(getData(), ds);
  }

  void logEvents(Collection data, DataSource ds) {

    // Iterate through the data and log each row.
    for (...) {
      try (Connection con = ds.getConnection(); ...) {
      
        // Write the data using our connection.
        ...

        // Commit.
        con.commit();
      }
    }
  }
}
----
====== Task Submission 

The task is started and stopped by a
`jakarta.servlet.ServletContextListener`.

[source,java]
----
public class CtxListener implements ServletContextListener {
  
  Future loggerHandle = null;

  @Resource(name=”concurrent/ScheduledLoggerExecutor”)
  ManagedScheduledExecutorService mes;

  public void contextInitialized(ServletContextEvent scEvent) {
    LoggerTimer logger = new LoggerTimer();
    loggerHandle = mes.scheduleAtFixedRate(logger, 5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
  }

  public void contextDestroyed(ServletContextEvent scEvent) {

    // Cancel and interrupt our logger task
    if(loggerHandle!=null) {
      loggerHandle.cancel(true);
    }
  }
}
----
==== Application Assembler’s Responsibilities 

The Application Assembler (EE.2.11.3) is responsible for assembling the
application components into a complete Jakarta EE Application and providing
assembly instructions that describe the dependencies to the managed
objects.

==== Deployer’s Responsibilities 

The Deployer (EE.2.11.4) is responsible for deploying the application
components into a specific operational environment. In the terms of this
specification, the Deployer installs the application components and maps
the dependencies defined by the Application Component Provider and
Application Assembler to managed objects with the properly defined
attributes. See EE.5.8.2 for details.

==== Jakarta EE Product Provider’s Responsibilities 

The Jakarta EE Product Provider’s responsibilities are as defined in
EE.5.8.3.

Jakarta EE Product Providers may include other contexts that may be
propagated to a task or `jakarta.enterprise.concurrent.ManagedTaskListener`
thread (e.g. Locale). `ManagedScheduledExecutorService` implementations
may add any additional contexts and provide the means for configuration
of those contexts in any way so long as these contexts do not violate
the required aspects of this specification.

The following section illustrates some possible configuration options
that a Jakarta EE Product Provider may want to provide.

===== ManagedScheduledExecutorService Configuration Attributes

Each `ManagedScheduledExecutorService` may support one or more runtime
behaviors as specified by configuration attributes. The Jakarta EE Product
Provider will determine both the appropriate attributes and the means of
configuring those attributes for their product.

===== Configuration Examples 

This section and subsections illustrate some examples of how a Jakarta EE
Product Provider could configure a ManagedScheduledExecutorService and
the possible options that such a service could provide.

Providers may choose a more simplistic approach, or may choose to add
more functionality, such as a higher quality-of-service or persistence.

Each of the examples has the following attributes:

* *Name*: An arbitrary name of the service for the deployer to use as a
reference.
* *JNDI name*: The arbitrary, but required, name to identify the service
instance. The deployer uses this value to map the service to the
component’s resource environment reference.
* *Context*: A reference to a ContextService instance (see section 3.3).
The context service can be used to define the context to propagate to
the threads when running tasks. Having multiple ContextService
instances, each with a different policy may be desirable for some
implementations. If both Context and ThreadFactory attributes are
specified, the Context attribute of the ThreadFactory configuration
should be ignored.
* *ThreadFactory*: A reference to a ManagedThreadFactory instance (see
section 3.4). The managed ThreadFactory instance can create threads with
different attributes (such as priority).
* *Thread Use*: If the application intends to run short vs. long-running
tasks they can specify to use pooled or daemon threads.
* *Hung Task Threshold*: The amount of time in milliseconds that a task
can execute before it is considered hung.
* *Pool Info*: If the executor is a thread pool, then the various thread
pool attributes can be defined (this is based on the attributes for the
Java `java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor` class):
** *Core Size*: The number of threads to keep in the pool, even if they
are idle.
** *Maximum Size*: The maximum number of threads to allow in the pool
(could be unbounded).
** *Keep Alive*: The time to allow threads to remain idle when the
number of threads is greater than the core size.
* *Reject Policy*: The policy to use when a task is to be rejected by
the executor. In this example, two policies are available:
** *Abort*: Throw an exception when rejected.
** *Retry and Abort*: Automatically resubmit to another instance and
abort if it fails.

====== Typical Timer 

[NOTE]
====
This example describes a typical configuration for a
`ManagedScheduledExecutorService` that uses a bounded thread pool. Only 10
timers can run simultaneously and are considered hung if they have run
more than 5 seconds. An executor such as this can be shared between
applications and is designed to run very short-duration tasks, for
example, marking a transaction to rollback after a timeout.

##Table : Typical Timer Configuration Example

===== Default ManagedScheduledExecutorService

The Jakarta EE Product Provider must provide a preconfigured, default
`ManagedScheduledExecutorService` for use by application components under
the JNDI name `java:comp/DefaultManagedScheduledExecutorService`. The
types of contexts to be propagated by this default
`ManagedScheduledExecutorService` from a contextualizing application
component must include naming context, class loader, and security
information.

==== System Administrator’s Responsibilities 

The System Administrator (EE.2.110.5) is responsible for monitoring and
overseeing the runtime environment. In the scope of this specification,
these duties may include:

* Monitoring for hung tasks.
* Monitoring resource usage (for example, threads and memory).

==== Lifecycle

The lifecycle of `ManagedScheduledExecutorService` instances are centrally
managed by the application server and cannot be changed by an
application.

A `ManagedScheduledExecutorService` instance can be used by multiple
components and applications. When the executor runs a task, the context
of the thread is changed to match the component instance that submitted
the task. The context is then restored when the task is complete. See
Figure 3‑1 Managed Thread Pool Executor Component Relationship.

`ManagedScheduledExecutorService` instances may be terminated or suspended
by the application server when applications or components are stopped or
the application server itself is shutting down.

===== Jakarta EE Product Provider Requirements 

This subsection describes requirements for
`ManagedScheduledExecutorService` providers.

[arabic]
. All tasks, when executed from the `ManagedScheduledExecutorService`,
will run with the context of the application component that submitted
the task.
. The lifecycle of a `ManagedScheduledExecutorService` is managed by an
application server. All lifecycle operations on the
`ManagedScheduledExecutorService` interface will throw a
`java.lang.IllegalStateException` exception. This includes the following
methods that are defined in the `java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService`
interface: `awaitTermination()`, `isShutdown()`, `isTerminated()`, `shutdown()`,
and `shutdownNow()`.
. All tasks submitted to an executor must not run if task’s component is
not started.

When a `ManagedScheduledExecutorService` instance is being shutdown by the
Jakarta EE Product Provider:

[arabic]
. All attempts to submit new tasks are rejected.
. All submitted tasks are cancelled if not running.
. All running task threads are interrupted.
. All registered `ManagedTaskListeners` are invoked.

==== Quality of Service 

`ManagedScheduledExecutorService` implementations must support the
at-most-once quality of service. The at-most-once quality of service
guarantees that a task will run at most, one time. This quality of
service is the most efficient method to run tasks. Tasks submitted to an
executor with this quality of service are transient in nature, are not
persisted, and do not survive process restarts.

Other qualities of service are allowed, but are not addressed in this
specification.

==== Transaction Management 

`ManagedScheduledExecutorService` implementations must support
user-managed global transaction demarcation using the
`jakarta.transaction.UserTransaction` interface, which is described in the
Jakarta Transactions specification. User-managed transactions allow
components to manually control global transaction demarcation
boundaries. Task implementations may optionally begin, commit, and
roll-back a transaction. See EE.4 for details on transaction management
in Jakarta EE.

Task instances are run outside of the scope of the transaction of the
submitting thread. Any transaction active in the executing thread will
be suspended.

===== Jakarta EE Product Provider Requirements 

This subsection describes the transaction management requirements of a
`ManagedScheduledExecutorService` implementation.

[arabic]
. The `jakarta.transaction.UserTransaction` interface must be made available
in the local JNDI namespace as environment entry:
`java:comp/UserTransaction` (J2EE.5.7 and J2EE.4.2.1.1)
. All resource managers must enlist with a `UserTransaction` instance when
a transaction is active using the `begin()` method.
. The executor is responsible for coordinating commits and rollbacks
when the transaction ends using `commit()` and `rollback()` methods.
. A task must have the same ability to use transactions as the component
submitting the tasks. For example, tasks are allowed to call
transactional enterprise beans, and managed beans that use the
`@Transactional` interceptor as defined in the Jakarta Transactions
specification.

===== Application Component Provider’s Requirements 

This subsection describes the transaction management requirements of
each task provider’s implementation.

[arabic]
. A task instance that starts a transaction must complete the
transaction before starting a new transaction.
. The task provider uses the `jakarta.transaction.UserTransaction` interface
to demarcate transactions.
. Transactions are demarcated using the `begin()`, `commit()` and `rollback()`
methods of the `UserTransaction` interface.
. While an instance is in an active transaction, resource-specific
transaction demarcation APIs must not be used (e.g., if a
`java.sql.Connection` is enlisted in the transaction instance, the
`Connection.commit()` and `Connection.rollback()` methods must not be used).
. The task instance must complete the transaction before the task method
ends.

See section 3.1.8.2.1 for an example on how to use a `UserTransaction`
within a task.

=== ContextService 

The `jakarta.enterprise.concurrent.ContextService` allows applications to
create contextual objects without using a managed executor. The
`ContextService` uses the dynamic proxy capabilities found in the
`java.lang.reflect` package or creates proxy instances in a
non-dynamic manner to associate the application component
container context with an object instance. The object becomes a
contextual object (see section 2.3.2 ) and whenever a method on the
contextual object is invoked, the method executes with the thread
context of the associated application component instance.

Contextual objects allow application components to develop a wide
variety of applications and services that are not normally possible in
the Jakarta EE platform, such as workflow systems. When used in conjunction
with a `ManagedThreadFactory`, customized Java SE platform ExecutorService
implementations can be used.

The ContextService also allows non-Jakarta EE service callbacks (such as
Jakarta Messaging MessageListeners and JMX NotificationListeners) to run in the
context of the listener registrant instead of the implementation
provider's undefined thread context.).

==== Application Component Provider’s Responsibilities 

Application Component Providers (application developers) (EE2.11.2) use
a ContextService instance to create contextual object proxies. Instances
for these objects are retrieved using the Java Naming and Directory
Interface (JNDI) Naming Context (EE.5) or through injection of resource
environment references (EE.5.8.1.1).

The Application Component Provider may use resource environment
references to obtain references to a ContextService instance as follows:

* Assign an entry in the application component’s environment to the
reference using the reference type of:
`jakarta.enterprise.concurrent.ContextService`. (See EE.5.8.1.2 for
information on how resource environment references are declared in the
deployment descriptor.)
* Look up the managed object in the application component’s environment
using JNDI (EE.5.2), or through resource injection by the use of the
`@Resource` annotation (EE.5.8.1.1).

This specification recommends, but does not require, that all resource
environment references be organized in the appropriate subcontext of the
component’s environment for the resource type. For example, all
`ContextService` references should be declared in the
`java:comp/env/concurrent` subcontext.

* Contextual object proxy instances are created with a `ContextService`
instance using the `createContextualProxy()` or `contextual*()` methods. Contextual object
proxies will run as an extension of the application component instance
that created the proxy and may interact with Jakarta EE container resources
as defined in other sections of this specification.

It is important for Application Component Providers to identify and
document the required behaviors and service-level agreements for each
required `ContextService`. The following example illustrates how the
component can describe and utilize a `ContextService`.

===== Usage Example 

This section provides an example that shows how a custom `ExecutorService`
can be utilized within an application component.

====== Custom ExecutorService

This example demonstrates how a singleton Java SE `ExecutorService`
implementation (such as the `java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor`) can
be used from a Jakarta Enterprise Bean. In this example, the reference `ThreadPoolExecutor`
implementation is used instead of the implementation supplied with the
Jakarta EE Product Provider.

A custom `ExecutorService` can be created like any Java object. For
applications to use an object, it can be accessed using a singleton or
using a Connectors resource adapter. In this example, we use a singleton
session bean.

Since the `ExecutorService` is a singleton session bean, it can be
accessed by several Jakarta Enterprise Beans or Servlet instances. The `ExecutorService` uses
threads created from a `ManagedThreadFactory` (see section 3.4) provided
by the Jakarta EE Product Provider. The `ContextService` is used to guarantee
that the task, when it runs on one of the worker threads in the pool,
will have the correct component context available to it.

====== ExecutorService Singleton 

Create a singleton session bean ExecutorAccessor with a getter for the
`ExecutorService`. The ExecutorAccessor should be included with the enterprise bean
module or other jar that is in the scope of the application component.

[source,java]
----
@Singleton
public class ExecutorAccessor {

  private ExecutorService threadPoolExecutor = null;

  @Resource(name="concurrent/ThreadFactory")
  ManagedThreadFactory threadFactory;

  @PostConstruct
  public void postConstruct() {
    threadPoolExecutor = new ThreadPoolExecutor( 5, 10, 5, TimeUnit.SECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<Runnable>(10), threadFactory);
  }

  public ExecutorService getThreadPool() {
    return threadPoolExecutor;
  }
}
----

====== CreditReport Task 

The CreditReport task retrieves a credit report from a given credit
agency for a given tax identification number. Multiple tasks are invoked
in parallel by an Enterprise Bean business method.

====== Resource Environment References 

This example refers to a `ContextService` and a `ManagedThreadFactory`.

[NOTE]
====
Using the description for documenting the configuration
attributes of the managed object is optional. The format used here is
only an example. Future revisions of Jakarta EE specifications may
formalize usages such as this._

----

====== Task Definition 

This task logs the request in a database, which requires the local
namespace in order to locate the correct Datasource. It also utilizes
the Java Authentication and Authorization API (JAAS) to retrieve the
user's identity from the current thread in order to audit access to the
credit report.

[source,java]
----
public class CreditScoreTask implements Callable<Long> {
  private long taxID;
  private int agency;

  public CreditScoreTask(long taxID, int agency) {
    this.taxID = taxID;
    this.agency = agency;
  }

  public Long call() {
    // Log the request in a database using the identity of the user.
    // Use the local namespace to locate the datasource
    Subject currentSubject = Subject.getSubject(AccessController.getContext());
    logCreditAccess(currentSubject, taxID, agency);

    // Use Web Services to retrieve the credit score from the
    // specified agency.
    return getCreditScore(taxID, agency);
  }

  ...
}
----

====== Task Invocation 

The `LoanCheckerBean` is a stateless session bean that has one method that
is used to retrieve the credit scores for one tax ID from three
different agencies. It uses three threads to accomplish this, including
the enterprise bean thread.

While the enterprise bean thread is retrieving one credit score, two other threads
are retrieving the other two scores.

[source,java]
----
class LoanCheckerBean {
  @Resource(name="concurrent/AllContexts")
  ContextService ctxSvc;

  @EJB private ExecutorAccessor executorAccessor;

  public long[] getCreditScores(long taxID) {
    // Retrieve our singleton threadpool, but wrap it in
    // a ExecutorCompletionService
    ExecutorCompletionService<Long> threadPool = new ExecutorCompletionService<Long>(executorAccessor.getThreadPool());

    // Use this thread to retrieve one credit score, and
    // use two other threads to process the other two scores.
    // Since we are using a custom executor and
    // because our tasks depend upon the context in which this
    // method is running, we use a contextual task.
    CreditScoreTask agency1 = new CreditScoreTask(taxID, 1);
    
    Callable<Long> agency2 = ctxSvc.createContextualProxy( new CreditScoreTask(taxID, 2), Callable.class));

    Callable<Long> agency3 = ctxSvc.createContextualProxy ( new CreditScoreTask(taxID, 3), Callable.class));

    threadPool.submit(agency2);
    threadPool.submit(agency3);

    long[] scores = {0,0,0};
    try {
      // Retrieve one credit score on this thread.
      scores[0] = agency1.call();

      // Retrieve the other two credit scores
      scores[1] = threadPool.take().get();
      scores[2] = threadPool.take().get();
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
      // The app may be shutting down.
    } catch (ExecutionException e) {
      // There was an error retrieving one of the asynch scores.
    }
    return scores;
  }
}
----

==== Application Assembler’s Responsibilities 

The Application Assembler (EE.2.11.3) is responsible for assembling the
application components into a complete Jakarta EE Application and providing
assembly instructions that describe the dependencies to the managed
objects.

==== Deployer’s Responsibilities 

The Deployer (EE.2.11.4) is responsible for deploying the application
components into a specific operational environment. In the terms of this
specification, the Deployer installs the application components and maps
the dependencies defined by the Application Component Provider and
Application Assembler to managed objects with the properly defined
attributes. See EE.5.8.2 for details.

All objects created by a `ContextService` instance are required to
propagate Jakarta EE container context information (see section 2.3) to the
methods invoked on the proxied object.

==== Jakarta EE Product Provider’s Responsibilities 

The Jakarta EE Product Provider’s responsibilities are as defined in
EE.5.8.3 and must provide an implementation of any behaviors defined in
the following:

* All invocation handlers for the contextual proxy implementation must
implement `java.io.Serializable`.

* All invocations to any of the proxied interface methods will fail with
a `java.lang.IllegalStateException` exception if the application component
is not started or deployed.

Jakarta EE Product Providers may add any additional container contexts to
the managed `ContextService` and provide the means for configuration of
those contexts in any way so long as these contexts do not violate the
required aspects of this specification.

The following section illustrates some possible configuration options
that a Jakarta EE Product Provider may want to provide.

===== ContextService Configuration Attributes 

Each `ContextService` may support one or more runtime behaviors as
specified by configuration attributes. The Jakarta EE Product Provider will
determine both the appropriate attributes and the means of configuring
those attributes for their product.

===== Configuration Examples 

This section and subsections illustrate some examples how a Jakarta EE
Product Provider could configure a `ContextService` and the possible
options that such a service could provide.

The `ContextService` can be used directly by application components by
using resource environment references or providers may choose to use the
context information supplied as default context propagation policies for
a `ManagedExecutorService`, `ManagedScheduledExecutorService` or
`ManagedThreadFactory`. The configuration examples covered in sections
3.1.4.2 3.2.4.2 and 3.4.4.2 refer to one of the `ContextService`
configuration examples that follow.

Each of the examples has the following attributes:

* *Name*: An arbitrary name of the service for the deployer to use as a
reference.
* *JNDI name*: The arbitrary, but required, name to identify the service
instance. The deployer uses this value to map the service to the
component’s resource environment reference.
* *Context info*: The context information to be propagated.
** *Security*: If enabled, propagate the container security principal.
** *Locale*: If enabled, the locale from the container thread is
propagated.
** *Custom*: If enabled, custom, thread-local data is propagated.

##Table : No Contexts Configuration Example

===== Default ContextService

The Jakarta EE Product Provider must provide a preconfigured, default
`ContextService` for use by application components under the JNDI name
`java:comp/DefaultContextService`. The types of contexts to be propagated
by this default `ContextService` from a contextualizing application
component must include naming context, class loader, and security
information.

==== Transaction Management 

Contextual dynamic proxies support user-managed global transaction
demarcation using the `jakarta.transaction.UserTransaction` interface, which
is described in the Jakarta Transactions specification. By default,
proxy methods suspend any transactional context on the thread and allow
components to manually control global transaction demarcation
boundaries. Context objects may optionally begin, commit, and rollback a
transaction. See EE.4 for details on transaction management in Jakarta EE.

By using an execution property when creating the contextual proxy
object, application components can choose to not suspend the
transactional context on the thread, and any resources used by the task
will be enlisted to that transaction. Refer to the Javadoc for the
`jakarta.enterprise.concurrent.ContextService` interface for details and
examples.

===== Jakarta EE Product Provider Requirements 

This subsection describes the transaction management requirements of a
`ContextService` implementation when transaction management is enabled
(this is the default behavior).

[arabic]
. The `jakarta.transaction.UserTransaction` interface must be made available
in the local JNDI namespace as environment entry:
`java:comp/UserTransaction` (EE.5.10 and EE.4.2.1.1)
. All resource managers must enlist with a `UserTransaction` instance when
a transaction is active using the `begin()` method.
. The executor is responsible for coordinating commits and rollbacks
when the transaction ends using `commit()` and `rollback()` methods.
. A task must have the same ability to use transactions as the component
submitting the tasks. For example, tasks are allowed to call
transactional enterprise beans, and managed beans that use the
`@Transactional` interceptor as defined in the Jakarta Transactions
specification.

===== Application Component Provider’s Requirements 

This subsection describes the transaction management requirements of
each task provider’s implementation when transaction management is
enabled (this is the default behavior).

[arabic]
. A task instance that starts a transaction must complete the
transaction before starting a new transaction.
. The task provider uses the `jakarta.transaction.UserTransaction` interface
to demarcate transactions.
. Transactions are demarcated using the `begin()`, `commit()` and `rollback()`
methods of the `UserTransaction` interface.
. While an instance is in an active transaction, resource-specific
transaction demarcation APIs must not be used (e.g. if a
`java.sql.Connection` is enlisted in the transaction instance, the
`Connection.commit()` and `Connection.rollback()` methods must not be used).
. The task instance must complete the transaction before the task method
ends.

See section 3.1.8.2.1 for an example of using a UserTransaction within a
task.

=== ManagedThreadFactory 

The `jakarta.enterprise.concurrent.ManagedThreadFactory` allows applications
to create thread instances from a Jakarta EE Product Provider without
creating new `java.lang.Thread` instances directly. This object allows
Application Component Providers to use custom executors such as the
`java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor` when advanced, specialized
execution patterns are required.

Jakarta EE Product Providers can provide custom `Thread` implementations to
add management capabilities and container contextual information to the
thread.

==== Application Component Provider’s Responsibilities 

Application Component Providers (application developers) (EE2.11.2) use
a `jakarta.enterprise.concurrent.ManagedThreadFactory` instance to create
manageable threads. `ManagedThreadFactory` instances are retrieved using
the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) Naming Context (EE.5) or
through injection of resource environment references (EE.5.8.1.1).

The Application Component Provider may use resource environment
references to obtain references to a `ManagedThreadFactory` instance as
follows:

* Assign an entry in the application component’s environment to the
reference using the reference type of:
`jakarta.enterprise.concurrent.ManagedThreadFactory`. (See EE.5.8.1.2 for
information on how resource environment references are declared in the
deployment descriptor.)
* This specification recommends, but does not require, that all resource
environment references be organized in the appropriate subcontext of the
component’s environment for the resource type. For Example, all
`ManagedThreadFactory` references should be declared in the
`java:comp/env/concurrent` subcontext.
* Look up the managed object in the application component’s environment
using JNDI (EE.5), or through resource injection by the use of the
`@Resource` annotation (EE.5.8.1.1).
* New threads are created using the `newThread(Runnable r)` method on the
`java.util.concurrent.ThreadFactory` interface.
* The application component thread has permission to interrupt the
thread. All other modifications to the thread are subject to the
security manager, if present.
* All Threads are contextual (see section 2.3). When the thread is
started using the `Thread.start()` method, the `Runnable` that is executed
will run with the context of the application component instance that
created the `ManagedThreadFactory` instance.

[NOTE]
====
The `ManagedThreadFactory` instance may be invoked from several
threads in the application component, each with a different container
context (for example, user identity). By always applying the context of
the `ManagedThreadFactory` creator, each thread has a consistent context.
If a different context is required for each thread, use the
`ContextService` to create a contextual object (see section_ _3.3)._
====

* If a `ManagedThreadFactory` instance is stopped, all subsequent calls to
`newThread()` must throw a `java.lang.IllegalStateException`

===== Usage Example

In this example, an application component uses a background daemon task
to dump in-memory events to a database log, similar to the timer usage
example in section 3.2.1.1.1 .

The attributes of the `ManagedThreadFactory` reference is documented using
the `<description>` tag within the deployment descriptor of the
application component and later mapped by the Deployer.

====== Logger Task 

The Logger Task is a long-running task that has the same lifecycle as
the servlet. It continually monitors a queue and waits for events to a
database log. Its lifecycle is controlled using a
`jakarta.servlet.ServletContextListener`.

====== Resource Environment Reference 

The following resource environment reference is added to the web.xml
file for the web component. The description reflects the desired
configuration attributes (see section 3.4.4.2 ). Alternatively, the
`@Resource` annotation can be used in the Servlet code.

[NOTE]
====
Using the description for documenting the configuration
attributes of the managed object is optional. The format used here is
only an example. Future revisions of Jakarta EE specifications may
formalize usages such as this._

[source,xml]
----
<resource-env-ref>
  <description>
    This ManagedThreadFactory is used to create a thread for for the
    application’s logger task.
    This ManagedThreadFactory has the following requirements:

  <resource-env-ref-type>
    jakarta.enterprise.concurrent.ManagedThreadFactory
  </resource-env-ref-type>
</resource-env-ref>
----
====== Task Definition 

The task itself simply uses a resource-reference to a JDBC data source,
and uses a connect/use/close pattern when invoking the Datasource.

[source,java]
----
public class LoggerTask implements Runnable {

  DataSource ds = ...;

  public void run() {
    // Wait for data and log it.
    while (!Thread.interrupted()) {
      logEvents(getData(), ds);
    }
  }

  void logEvents(Collection data, DataSource ds) {
    // Iterate through the data and log each row.
    for (...) {
      try (Connection con = ds.getConnection();... {

        // Write the data using our connection.
        ...

        // Commit.
        con.commit();
      }
    }
  }
}
----
====== Task Submission 

The task is started and stopped by a
`jakarta.servlet.ServletContextListener`.

[source,java]
----
public class CtxListener implments ServletContextListener {

  Thread loggerThread = null;

  @Resource(name=”concurrent/LoggerThreadFactory”)
  ManagedThreadFactory threadFactory;

  public void contextInitialized(ServletContextEvent scEvent) {
    LoggerTask logger = new LoggerTask();
    Thread loggerThread = threadFactory.newThread(logger);
    loggerThread.start();
  }

  public void contextDestroyed(ServletContextEvent scEvent) {
    // Interrupt our logger task since it is no longer available.
    // Note: The server will do this for us as well.
    if (loggerThread!=null) {
      loggerThread.interrupt();
    }
  }
}
----
==== Application Assembler’s Responsibilities 

The Application Assembler (EE.2.11.3) is responsible for assembling the
application components into a complete Jakarta EE Application and providing
assembly instructions that describe the dependencies to the managed
objects.

==== Deployer’s Responsibilities 

The Deployer (EE.2.11.4) is responsible for deploying the application
components into a specific operational environment. In the terms of this
specification, the Deployer installs the application components and maps
the dependencies defined by the Application Component Provider and
Application Assembler to managed objects with the properly defined
attributes. See EE.5.8.2 for details.

==== Jakarta EE Product Provider’s Responsibilities 

The Jakarta EE Product Provider’s responsibilities are as defined in
EE.5.8.3 and must support the following:

* Threads returned by the `newThread()` method must implement the
`ManageableThread` interface.
* When a `ManagedThreadFactory` instance is stopped, such as when the
component that created it is stopped or when the application server is
shutting down, all threads that it has created using the `newThread()`
method are interrupted. Calls to the `isShutdown()` method in the
`ManageableThread` interface on these threads must return true.

[NOTE]
====
The intent is to prevent access to components that are no
longer available._
====

* Threads that are created by a `ManagedThreadFactory` instance but are
started after the `ManagedThreadFactory` has shut down is required to
start with an interrupted status. Calls to the `isShutdown()` method in
the `ManageableThread` interface on these threads must return true.

All threads created by a `ManagedThreadFactory` instance are required to
propagate container context information (see section 2.3) to the
thread’s `Runnable`.

Jakarta EE Product Providers may add any additional container contexts to
the managed `ManagedThreadFactory` and provide the means for configuration
of those contexts in any way so long as these contexts do not violate
the required aspects of this specification.

The following section illustrates some possible configuration options
that a Jakarta EE Product Provider may want to provide.

===== ManagedThreadFactory Configuration Attributes 

Each managed `ManagedThreadFactory` may support one or more runtime
behaviors as specified by configuration attributes. The Jakarta EE Product
Provider will determine both the appropriate attributes and the means of
configuring those attributes for their product.

===== Configuration Examples 

This section and subsections illustrate some examples of how a Jakarta EE
Product Provider could configure a `ManagedThreadFactory` and the possible
options that such a service could provide.

A `ManagedThreadFactory` can be used directly by application components by
using resource environment references, or providers may choose to use
the context information supplied as default context propagation policies
for `ManagedExecutorService`, or `ManagedScheduledExecutorService`
instances. The configuration examples covered in sections 3.1.4.2 and
3.2.4.2 refer to one of the `ManagedThreadFactory` configuration examples
that follow.

Each of the examples has the following attributes:

* *Name*: An arbitrary name of the service for the deployer to use as a
reference.
* *JNDI name*: The arbitrary, but required, name to identify the service
instance. The deployer uses this value to map the service to the
component’s resource environment reference.
* *Context*: A reference to a `ContextService` instance (see section 3.3).
The context service can be used to define the context to propagate to
the threads when running tasks. Having multiple `ContextService`
instances, each with a different policy may be desirable for some
implementations.
* *Priority*: The priority to assign to the thread (the higher the
number, the higher the priority). See the `java.lang.Thread` Javadoc for
details on how this value can be used.

====== Normal Threads 

This configuration example illustrates a typical `ManagedThreadFactory`
that creates normal priority threads with all available context
information.

##Table : Long-Running Tasks
ManagedThreadFactory Configuration Example

===== Default ManagedThreadFactory

The Jakarta EE Product Provider must provide a preconfigured, default
`ManagedThreadFactory` for use by application components under the JNDI
name `java:comp/DefaultManagedThreadFactory`. The types of contexts to be
propagated by this default `ManagedThreadFactory` from a contextualizing
application component must include naming context, class loader, and
security information.

==== System Administrator’s Responsibilities 

The System Administrator (EE.2.11.5) is responsible for monitoring and
overseeing the runtime environment. In the scope of this specification,
these duties may include:

* Monitoring for hung tasks.
* Monitoring resource usage (for example, threads and memory).

==== Transaction Management 

`ManagedThreadFactory` implementations must support user-managed global
transaction demarcation using the `jakarta.transaction.UserTransaction`
interface, which is described in the Jakarta Transactions specification
s with similar semantics to Jakarta Enterprise Beans bean-managed transaction demarcation
(see the Jakarta Enterprise Beans specification). User-managed transactions
allow components to manually control global transaction demarcation
boundaries. Task implementations may optionally begin, commit, and
roll-back a transaction. See EE.4 for details on transaction management
in Jakarta EE.

Task instances are run outside of the scope of the transaction of the
submitting thread. Any transaction active in the executing thread will
be suspended.

===== Jakarta EE Product Provider Requirements 

This subsection describes the transaction management requirements of a
ManagedThreadFactory implementation.

[arabic]
. The `jakarta.transaction.UserTransaction` interface must be made available
in the local JNDI namespace as environment entry:
`java:comp/UserTransaction` (EE.5.10 and EE.4.2.1.1)
. All resource managers must enlist with a `UserTransaction` instance when
a transaction is active using the `begin()` method.
. The executor is responsible for coordinating commits and rollbacks
when the transaction ends using `commit()` and `rollback()` methods.
. A task must have the same ability to use transactions as the component
submitting the tasks. For example, tasks are allowed to call
transactional enterprise beans, and managed beans that use the
`@Transactional` interceptor as defined in the Jakarta Transactions
specification.

===== Application Component Provider’s Requirements 

This subsection describes the transaction management requirements of
each task provider’s implementation.

[arabic]
. A task instance that starts a transaction must complete the
transaction before starting a new transaction.
. The task provider uses the `jakarta.transaction.UserTransaction` interface
to demarcate transactions.
. Transactions are demarcated using the `begin()`, `commit()` , and
`rollback()` methods of the UserTransaction interface.
. While an instance is in an active transaction, resource-specific
transaction demarcation APIs must not be used (e.g. if a
`java.sql.Connection` is enlisted in the transaction instance, the
`Connection.commit()` and `Connection.rollback()` methods must not be used).
. The task instance must complete the transaction before the task method
ends.

See section 3.1.8.2.1 for an example of using a `UserTransaction` within a
task.
