/**
 * Triggers allow application developers to plug in rules for when 
 * and how often a task should run. The trigger can be as simple as 
 * a single, absolute date-time or can include Java&trade; EE business 
 * calendar logic. A Trigger implementation is created by the 
 * application developer (or may be supplied to the application 
 * externally) and is registered with a task when it is submitted 
 * to a {@link ManagedScheduledExecutorService} using any of the 
 * schedule methods. Each method will run with unspecified context. 
 * The methods can be made contextual through creating contextual
 * proxy objects using {@link ContextService}.
 * <p>
 * Each Trigger instance will be invoked within the same process 
 * in which it was registered.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Example:
 * <pre>
 * &#47;**
 *  * A trigger that only returns a single date.
 *  *&#47;
 *  public class SingleDateTrigger implements Trigger {
 *      private Date fireTime;
 *      
 *      public TriggerSingleDate(Date newDate) {
 *          fireTime = newDate;
 *      }
 *
 *      public Date getNextRunTime(
 *         LastExecution lastExecutionInfo, Date taskScheduledTime) {
 *         
 *         if(taskScheduledTime.after(fireTime)) {
 *             return null;
 *         }
 *         return fireTime;
 *      }
 *
 *      public boolean skipRun(LastExecution lastExecutionInfo, Date scheduledRunTime) {
 *          return scheduledRunTime.after(fireTime);
 *      }
 *  }
 *
 * &#47;**
 *  * A fixed-rate trigger that will skip any runs if
 *  * the latencyAllowance threshold is exceeded (the task
 *  * ran too late).
 *  *&#47;
 *  public class TriggerFixedRateLatencySensitive implements Trigger {
 *      private Date startTime;
 *      private long delta;
 *      private long latencyAllowance;
 *
 *      public TriggerFixedRateLatencySensitive(Date startTime, long delta, long latencyAllowance) {
 *          this.startTime = startTime;
 *          this.delta = delta;
 *          this.latencyAllowance = latencyAllowance;
 *      }
 *
 *      public Date getNextRunTime(LastExecution lastExecutionInfo, 
 *                                 Date taskScheduledTime) {
 *          if(lastExecutionInfo==null) {
 *              return startTime;
 *          }
 *          return new Date(lastExecutionInfo.getScheduledStart().getTime() + delta);
 *      }
 *
 *      public boolean skipRun(LastExecution lastExecutionInfo, Date scheduledRunTime) {
 *          return System.currentTimeMillis() - scheduledRunTime.getTime() > latencyAllowance;
 *      }
 *  }
