import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService;

/**
 * A manageable version of a {@link java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService}.<p>
 *
 * A ManagedScheduledExecutorService extends the Java&trade; SE ScheduledExecutorService
 * to provide methods for submitting delayed or periodic tasks for execution in
 * a Java&trade; EE environment.
 * Implementations of the ManagedScheduledExecutorService are
 * provided by a Java&trade; EE Product Provider.  Application Component Providers
 * use the Java Naming and Directory Interface&trade; (JNDI) to look-up instances of one
 * or more ManagedScheduledExecutorService objects using resource environment references.
 * ManagedScheduledExecutorService instances can also be injected into application
 * components through the use of the {@code Resource} annotation.<p>
 *
 * The Concurrency Utilities for Java&trade; EE specification describes several
 * behaviors that a ManagedScheduledExecutorService can implement.  The Application
 * Component Provider and Deployer identify these requirements and map the
 * resource environment reference appropriately.<p>
 *
 * Tasks are run in managed threads provided by the Java&trade; EE Product Provider
 * and are run within the application component context that submitted the task.
 * All tasks run without an explicit transaction (they do not enlist in the application
 * component's transaction).  If a transaction is required, use a
 * {@code javax.transaction.UserTransaction} instance.  A UserTransaction instance is
 * available in JNDI using the name: &QUOT;java:comp/UserTransaction&QUOT or by
 * requesting an injection of a {@link javax.transaction.UserTransaction} object
 * using the {@code Resource} annotation.<p>
 *
 * Example:
 * <pre>
 *
 * public run() {
 *   // Begin of task
 *   InitialContext ctx = new InitialContext();
 *   UserTransaction ut = (UserTransaction) ctx.lookup("java:comp/UserTransaction");
 *   ut.begin();
 *
 *   // Perform transactional business logic
 *
 *   ut.commit();
 * }
 * </PRE>
 * Tasks can optionally provide an {@link ManagedTaskListener} to receive 
 * notifications of lifecycle events, through the use of {@link ManagedTask}
 * interface.
 * <p>
 *
 * Asynchronous tasks are typically submitted to the ManagedScheduledExecutorService using one
 * of the <code>submit</code> or <code>schedule</code>methods, each of which return a <CODE>Future</CODE>
 * instance.  The Future represents the result of the task and can also be used to
 * check if the task is complete or wait for its completion.<p>
 *
 * If the task is cancelled, the result for the task is a
 * <CODE>CancellationException</CODE> exception.  If the task is unable
 * to run due to start due to a reason other than cancellation, the result is a
 * {@link AbortedException} exception.  If the task is scheduled
 * with a {@link Trigger} and the Trigger forces the task to be skipped,
 * the result will be a {@link SkippedException} exception.<p>
 *
 * Tasks can be scheduled to run periodically using the <code>schedule</code> methods that
 * take a <code>Trigger</code> as an argument and the <code>scheduleAtFixedRate</code> and
 * <code>scheduleWithFixedDelay</code> methods.  The result of the <code>Future</code> will
 * be represented by the currently scheduled or running instance of the task.  Future and past executions
 * of the task are not represented by the Future.  The state of the <code>Future</code> will therefore change
 * and multiple results are expected.<p>
 *
 * For example, if a task is repeating, the lifecycle of the task would be:<br>
 * (Note:  See {@link ManagedTaskListener} for task lifecycle management details.)<p>

 * <table>
 * <tr><td valign="top"><strong>Sequence</strong></td><td valign="top"><strong>State</strong></td><td valign="top"><strong>Action</strong></td><td valign="top"><strong>Listener</strong></td><td valign="top"><strong>Next state</strong></td></tr>
